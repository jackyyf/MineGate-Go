# MineGate-Go ![Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/jackyyf/MineGate-Go.svg)

  Minegate is a tool that focused on providing the missing virtual host 
functionality, which is supported by the protocol.

## Usage

  Please refer to config.yml for configuration. Place config.yml within
current directory, and minegate will load it automatically. Custom 
config file support will be added soon.

  Feature requests are welcome via issues.
